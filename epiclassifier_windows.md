## Epiclassifier Windows

Epiclassifier is fully composed of source files and functions from Episodus EHR [1]
 written by Philippe Ameline.

Episodus EHR was writtent for Windows OS.

This branch epiclassifier_windows contains bits and pieces that are relevant
mostly to Episodus EHR and the Windows environment.

True to the Unix philosophy (a set of cultural norms and philosophical
approaches to minimalist, modular software development),in the master branch,
we will get rid of the code that is not necessary
 * for the Linux environment
 * to accomplish the specific tasks of Epiclassifier

Feel free to merge back any improvements from the master branch to this one.
